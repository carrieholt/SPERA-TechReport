# Introduction
There are approximately 460 Conservation Unit (CUs) of Pacific salmon, of which a large proportion have been assessed or are expected to be assessed with poor status below conservation thresholds. The modernized Fisheries Act (2019) requires rebuilding plans for major stocks (aggregates of CUs) that drop below limit reference points. In addition, Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy requires actions be considered to rebuild CUs above lower biological benchmarks. In addition, However, progress on developing rebuilding plans has been limited by a lack of tools to identify and evaluate management actions. Once identified, fisheries managers face the additional challenge of identifying how to best achieve CU-specific targets within multiple mixed-CU fisheries using the management tools available to them. Our goal is to create a tool for developing and evaluating harvest component of rebuilding plans for Pacific salmon that evaluates trade-offs between conservation objectives and other fisheries management objectives. Our specific objectives are to develop tools to identify CU-specific targets to achieve recovery, and secondarily, explore how to achieve targets in the context of multiple mixed-stock fisheries. Furthermore, tools can evaluate the extent to which reductions in harvest will impact rebuilding potential, if at all. In particular, the tool considers environmental forcing of population dynamics that may impact productivity and confound recovery efforts.

Here we focus primarily on harvest guidelines to respond to depleted CUs before more detailed strategies that integrate multiple management interventions (e.g., habitat and hatcheries) and stakeholders can be developed. The outcomes from this project are intended to form the first step in development of an integrated rebuilding plan that includes engagement with First Nations and stakeholders. In this first phase, we aim to develop a prototype quantitative tool applied to two case studies that can be expanded within an broader simulation framework and context of multiple stressors (“Management Strategy Evaluation”) in future phases. During this phase we are particularly interested in identifying overarching rebuilding goals that would shape decision making.
