# Introduction
There are approximately 460 Conservation Units (CUs) of Pacific salmon, of which a large proportion have been assessed or are expected to be assessed with poor status below conservation thresholds. Rebuilding plans are now required for major stocks (aggregates of CUs that are management together) that drop below limit reference points under the revised Fisheries Act (2019). In addition, Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy specifies that actions should be considered to rebuild CUs when they drop below lower biological benchmarks. However, progress on developing rebuilding plans has been limited, in part because of a lack of tools to identify and evaluate management actions for depleted CUs. Once identified, fisheries managers face the additional challenge of identifying how to best achieve CU-specific targets within multiple mixed-CU fisheries. 

Our overall goal was to create a tool for developing and evaluating the harvest component of rebuilding plans for Pacific salmon, which evaluates trade-offs between conservation objectives and other fisheries management objectives. In the first phase, we developed a prototype to evaluate the extent to which reductions in harvest impact rebuilding potential, if at all, and explore how to achieve rebuilding targets in the context of multiple mixed-stock fisheries. In addition, we considered environmental forcing of population dynamics that may impact productivity and confound recovery efforts. The rebuilding tool was scoped to focus on harvest actions before more detailed strategies that integrate multiple management interventions (e.g., habitat and hatcheries) can be developed to support rebuilding.  The outcomes from this project are intended to form the first step in the development of an integrated rebuilding plan that includes engagement with First Nations and stakeholders. In this first phase, we applied the prototype to two case studies (data-rich and data-poor examples), which can be expanded in future phases within a broader simulation framework and context of multiple stressors (“Management Strategy Evaluation”). 

## Policy Context 
DFO’s Fisheries Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach (Precautionary Approach Framework) provides guidance on how to manage fisheries in a precautionary manner. This framework states that “when a stock has reached the Critical Zone, a rebuilding plan must be in place with the aim of having a high probability of the stock growing out of the Critical Zone within a reasonable timeframe”. Further direction is provided in DFO’s “Guidance for the Development of Rebuilding Plans under the Precautionary Approach Framework: Growing Stocks out of the Critical Zone” (Guidance on Rebuilding), an annex of the Precautionary Approach Framework. This guidance document recommends the development of simulation models within the context of “Management Strategy Evaluations” (MSE) to examine the consequences of alternative management measures aimed at rebuilding depleted stocks under different plausible hypotheses about uncertain population and fisheries dynamics. It further states that transparency in responding to trade-offs among objectives (e.g., conservation and socio-economic) is essential for effective decision making, and that MSE can aid in building in stronger relationships among DFO, First Nations, and stakeholders, fostering open and transparent decision making. Given expectations from First Nations for increased collaboration and involvement in decision-making, MSE may provide a platform for this engagement.
