  Rebuilding plans are required for depleted stocks under the Fish Stock Provisions of Canada’s revised Fisheries Act (2019) and DFO’s Sustainable Fisheries Framework (2009). The overall goal of this project was to create a tool for developing and evaluating the harvest component of rebuilding plans for Pacific salmon, which evaluates trade-offs between conservation objectives and other fisheries management objectives. This rebuilding tool, called `samSim` can be used to explore performance of candidate rebuilding harvest strategies in the context of multiple mixed-stock fisheries and environmental forcing of population dynamics that may impact productivity and confound recovery efforts. `samSim` was scoped to focus on harvest actions before more detailed strategies that integrate multiple management interventions (e.g., habitat and hatcheries) can be developed to support rebuilding.  The outcomes from this project are intended to form the first step towards an integrated rebuilding plan that includes First Nations and stakeholders. In this first phase, we applied the `samSim` to two case studies: Fraser Rivers sockeye salmon, a data-rich example, and Nass River chum salmon, which was relatively data limited. `samSim` can be expanded in future phases within a broader simulation framework and context of multiple stressors. The tool, `samSim`,  is freely accessible and documented in a public repository online.
